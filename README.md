# Natural Selection
My own version of Natural Selection simulator inspired by [Primer's video on Youtube](https://youtu.be/0ZGbIKd0XrM)

## Introduction
- This version of natural selection simulator depicts a bunch of "bunny" bots which have multiple variables in a DNA sub-class. As bunnies reproduce and spread their genes, they are faced with survival tasks (which are just to eat food and drink water).
- The user will be given continuous updates on the screen as to the latest changes in the scene. Also, the total population will be displayed in real time.
- You can change the spawn rate of food by adjusting the slider at the bottom
- Finally, a summary is provided giving the major aspects of the DNA associated with the last surviving bunny.
- It is interesting to note the changes in the final DNA as the conditions are varied with respect to time.
